Summary: Non-native species invasions are causing worldwide ecosystem degradation and economic loss. Why some exotic species are invasive? Why some sites are more vulnerable than others?
---

Land managers spend substantial time and money to control species invasions and to conserve native communities. Given the accelerating pace of species invasions and limited conservation resources available, it is essential to understand why some exotic species are invasive? Why some sites are more vulnerable than others? How distributions of exotic species are affected by environmental factors? Are such relationships similar or different from those of native species? Can we predict which introduced species will be the most harmful invaders at where? We are interested in the mechanisms of species invasions and how our research can be used to inform policy makers.
