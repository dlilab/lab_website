Summary: Understanding and predicting complex ecological dynamics requires data collection (small or large), data cleaning, and appropriate data analysis. We are developing data and software tools to facilitate reproducible and reliable research workflows.

Increasingly, large amounts of data have become publicly available including global data on species distributions, landscape features via remote sensing, climates, species traits, digitization of museum specimens, etc. Meanwhile, most journals and funders require data to be deposited and open for publications, which resulted in a really rich collection of small to mediate size datasets. New data and software tools are required to analyze these voluminous and heterogeneous data to generate logical and compelling conclusions has not kept pace.

We are an open science lab and contribute our data to international networks such as the [forestReplot](https://forestreplot.ugent.be/) and [GUBIC](https://cubes-labs.com/gubic/). We are also developing several [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) packages for ecological research (e.g. [`hillR`](https://github.com/daijiang/hillR), [`rr2`](https://github.com/arives/rr2), [`phyr`](https://github.com/daijiang/phyr)). We are committed to develop more tools to facilitate reproducible and reliable ecological research.
